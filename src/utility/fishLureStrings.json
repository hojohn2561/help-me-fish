The following are some recommendations based on your fishing conditions, however, that doesn't mean you have to follow the suggestions to a tee. Half the fun in fishing is trying new things, and seeing if they work!",

They come in a variety of shapes, sizes, weights, and running depth, so what's important is choosing the right crankbait for the right conditions. Also remember that they are \"contact\" lures, meaning that you have a higher chance of enticing a bass after it deflects off an object.",
